# Project 1 : Stack
### Made for data structures course fall 2019

### Instructions I was given for this homework project

Your program should test the correctness of your implementation in function main. You should provide
test case to verify your stack works for the following cases:

1. Pushing an element of data onto a newly created stack
2. Pushing an element of data onto a non-empty stack
3. Pushing an element of data onto an empty stack (Note: a stack is empty when it is newly created
and after the last element is popped off the stack)
4. Popping a value from a newly created stack
5. Popping a value from a non-empty stack
6. Popping a value from an empty stack
7. Performing a sequence of consecutive pushes and pops
8. Peeking at the top of a newly create stack with peek
9. Peeking at the top of a non-empty stack
10. Peeking at the top of an empty stack.
